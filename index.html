            <p>Welcome to my Skills Portfolio for DCDA 40833. I co-lead this course with Dr. Curt Rode. Each semester we design a course to challenge students, and ourselves, to push the boundaries of digital culture and data analytics. This site showcases that work, and acts as an archive of our skills, views, and interests in DCDA for a given year.</p>
            <p>Each page represents a different lab assignment, building from foundational web development skills to data visualization and interactive mapping. The completed efforts shown on these pages serve as examples for our students and documentation of my own lifelong learning.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> I am Dr. Sean M. Crotty. I'm an associate professor in the Geography Department at TCU, and one of the founding faculty for the DCDA program. I have co-led the DCDA course with Dr. Curt Rode since 2018. </p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I'm interested in using spatial data analysis to help explain and visualize the way under-studied phenomena operate in urban environments. My research focuses on the informal and illicit economy, as well as more traditional businesses that have not been studied for one reason or another. I'm drawn to topics where data is messy, public understanding is limited, and geographic perspectives can provide unique insights. </p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> In leading the DCDA capston course, I am always forced to learn about emerging technologies and methods for both data analytics, which is my main area of expertise, but also in digital culture - for which I have much less formal training, but I find fascinating and exciting to explore.</p>
